# Complete Balance Test & Analysis Prompt

## Mission

Execute the optimal AI balance test and provide a comprehensive analysis identical to expert-level game balance evaluation, including detailed timeline breakdown, performance assessment, and actionable recommendations.

## Step 1: Execute Test

Run the balance test with optimal AI configuration:

```powershell
python optimal_ai_balance_test.py --waves 50 --runs 10
```

## Step 2: Comprehensive Log Analysis

Read the generated log file from `logs/optimal_ai_balance_test_[TIMESTAMP].log` and extract every significant event with precise timestamps.

## Step 3: Generate Expert Analysis Report

### **Phase 1: Test Configuration & Setup**

Document:

- Game initialization status
- Docker/server startup confirmation
- Map selection and initial game state
- Starting conditions (health: 20/20, currency: 95, etc.)

### **Phase 2: Wave-by-Wave Timeline**

For each wave, create detailed chronological breakdown:

#### **Preparation Phase Analysis**

- Countdown timer duration and events
- AI strategic decision-making process
- Tower placement attempts (successful/failed)
- Economic resource allocation
- Positioning strategy evaluation

#### **Active Combat Analysis**

- Enemy spawn patterns and characteristics
- Tower engagement statistics
- Projectile hit/miss ratios
- Enemy elimination progression
- Health loss patterns and critical moments
- Economic growth through enemy rewards
- Performance metrics (FPS, entity counts)

#### **Transition Analysis**

- Wave completion triggers and timing
- Economic bonuses and score updates
- Strategic adjustments for next wave
- Resource status and planning

### **Phase 3: Technical Performance Evaluation**

#### **System Performance**

- FPS stability throughout test
- Entity count management (enemies, towers, projectiles)
- Memory and processing efficiency
- Performance degradation points

#### **Logging System Validation**

- Message frequency and throttling effectiveness
- Information quality and completeness
- Absence of flooding or spam
- Event capture accuracy

#### **AI Decision Quality**

- Strategic tower placement choices (targeting 109.4+ positioning scores)
- Economic management efficiency
- Timing of defensive expansion
- Adaptation to changing conditions

### **Phase 4: Balance Assessment Matrix**

#### **Quantitative Metrics**

- Success rate percentage (target: 65-75% for optimal AI play)
- Average waves completed
- Final player health status
- Enemy kill efficiency ratio
- Economic progression rate
- Time to failure (if applicable)

#### **Qualitative Evaluation**

- Player experience quality
- Strategic depth and decision complexity
- Difficulty curve appropriateness
- Engagement and challenge balance

### **Phase 5: Critical Event Analysis**

Identify and analyze:

#### **Success Factors**

- Effective tower placements and timing
- Successful economic management
- Strategic decisions that prevented failure
- Technical systems performing correctly

#### **Failure Points**

- Critical moments leading to health loss
- Economic pressure and resource constraints
- Enemy overwhelming scenarios
- Technical limitations or bottlenecks

### **Phase 6: Expert Recommendations**

#### **Balance Adjustments** (if needed)

- Specific parameter modifications with values
- Enemy health/damage adjustments
- Economic tuning (currency rewards, costs)
- Tower effectiveness modifications
- Wave timing and spawn rate changes

#### **Technical Improvements**

- Performance optimization opportunities
- Logging and monitoring enhancements
- AI decision-making refinements
- System stability improvements
