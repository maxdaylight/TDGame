# Real-Time Balance Testing

This directory contains the definitive real-time balance testing system for the Tower Defense game, providing 100% accurate testing using the actual game engine.

## üéØ Real-Time Testing Workflow

### Primary Testing (Use for all changes)

```bash
# Real-time comprehensive analysis (ONLY TESTING METHOD)
python real_balance_test.py --waves 50 --runs 10
```

## ‚≠ê `real_balance_test.py` - **100% ACCURATE REAL-TIME TESTING**

**The only testing tool you need** - Uses actual game engine for perfect accuracy:

- **Real browser automation**: Launches actual game in Chrome via Selenium
- **Docker integration**: Automatically starts game containers
- **Live game state extraction**: Reads real-time data from running JavaScript engine
- **Complete system testing**: All mechanics, gems, AI, pathfinding, targeting
- **Multiple skill levels**: Tests optimal, expert, above-average, average, and below-average players
- **Real player simulation**: Clicks, placements, timing based on actual human behavior

### Key Features

- **Perfect accuracy**: Uses actual game mechanics, not mathematical approximations
- **Complete gem system**: Tests all gem combinations and socketing
- **Real enemy AI**: Pathfinding, collision detection, status effects
- **Actual targeting**: Tower prioritization and range calculations
- **Performance monitoring**: FPS tracking and performance analysis

```bash
# Standard comprehensive real-time test
python real_balance_test.py

# Detailed analysis with specific waves
python real_balance_test.py --waves 5 --runs 3

# Test specific skill levels
python real_balance_test.py --skills above_average expert --waves 3
```

### Dependencies Required

- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For game container environment
- **Chrome Browser**: For Selenium automation
- **Python packages**: `selenium`, `requests`, `asyncio`

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install selenium requests

# Ensure Chrome and ChromeDriver are installed
# Docker must be running
```

## Target Success Rates

- **Early Waves (1-3)**: 65-75% success rate for above-average players
- **Mid Waves (4-6)**: 55-70% success rate for above-average players  
- **Late Waves (7+)**: 45-65% success rate for above-average players

## Real-Time Testing Process

1. **Environment Setup**: Automatically launches Docker containers
2. **Browser Launch**: Opens Chrome with game loaded
3. **Player Simulation**: Simulates different skill levels with realistic behavior:
   - **Optimal**: Frame-perfect execution, optimal strategies
   - **Expert**: Excellent decisions with occasional micro errors
   - **Above Average**: Good strategy with some inefficiencies
   - **Average**: Basic understanding with moderate execution
   - **Below Average**: Poor decisions and slow reactions

4. **Live Data Collection**: Extracts real game state every frame:
   - Health, money, wave progress
   - Tower placements and upgrades
   - Enemy positions and health
   - Projectile tracking
   - FPS and performance metrics

5. **Analysis**: Provides comprehensive balance assessment

## Integration with Development Workflow

### **MANDATORY PROCESS for all game balance changes:**

1. **Before Changes**:

   ```bash
   python real_balance_test.py --waves 3 --runs 2
   ```

2. **Make Changes**: Edit `towers.js`, `enemies.js`, or `game.js`

3. **Test Changes**:

   ```bash
   python real_balance_test.py --waves 3 --runs 2
   ```

4. **Validate Results**: Ensure success rates are within target ranges

5. **Docker Test**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

6. **Manual Verification**: Test gameplay in browser at <http://localhost:3000>

### Balance Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run `python real_balance_test.py` before changes
- [ ] Make changes to game files
- [ ] Run `python real_balance_test.py` after changes  
- [ ] Ensure above-average players have 65-75% success rate for early waves
- [ ] Test with Docker: `docker-compose up --build`
- [ ] Manual verification in browser

## Interpreting Results

### ‚úÖ **BALANCED GAME**

- Above-average players: 65-75% success rate (early waves)
- Expert players: 75-85% success rate
- Optimal players: 85-95% success rate

### ‚ùå **GAME TOO EASY**

- Above-average players: >85% success rate
- Players consistently finish with high health/money
- **Action**: Increase enemy health, reduce tower damage, or reduce starting money

### ‚ùå **GAME TOO HARD**  

- Above-average players: <55% success rate
- Players consistently lose early waves
- **Action**: Decrease enemy health, increase tower damage, or increase starting money

## Critical Balance Parameters

```javascript
// Current settings (automatically extracted from source)
STARTING_MONEY: 170          // From game.js
BASIC_TOWER_DAMAGE: 22       // From towers.js  
BASIC_TOWER_COST: 45         // From towers.js
BASIC_ENEMY_HEALTH: 120      // From enemies.js
```

## Real-Time Testing vs Simulation

**Why Real-Time Testing is Superior:**

| Aspect | Mathematical Simulation | Real-Time Testing |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Accuracy** | ~85% (approximations) | 100% (actual engine) |
| **Gem System** | Simplified | Complete mechanics |
| **AI Behavior** | Estimated | Actual pathfinding |
| **Performance** | Not tested | Real FPS monitoring |
| **Player Behavior** | Mathematical model | Realistic simulation |
| **Edge Cases** | Often missed | Naturally discovered |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Docker not running**: Ensure Docker Desktop is started
2. **Chrome not found**: Install Google Chrome browser
3. **Port conflicts**: Ensure ports 3000/3001 are available
4. **Selenium errors**: Update ChromeDriver to match Chrome version

### Setup Verification

```bash
# Test Docker
docker --version
docker-compose --version

# Test Chrome (Windows)
& "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --version

# Test Python packages
python -c "import selenium; print('Selenium OK')"
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Test Duration**: ~2-3 minutes per skill level per run
- **Resource Usage**: Moderate CPU/RAM during browser automation
- **Parallel Testing**: Not recommended (browser conflicts)
- **Headless Mode**: Available for faster CI testing

## Summary

The `real_balance_test.py` system provides the definitive balance assessment for the Tower Defense game by running actual gameplay scenarios with realistic player behavior simulation. This approach eliminates the approximation errors of mathematical models and provides 100% accurate balance analysis using the complete game engine.

**Always use real-time testing for balance validation - it's the only way to ensure your changes work correctly in the actual game environment.**
